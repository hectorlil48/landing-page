# landing-page

Will be creating a landing page using flexbox and all the styles I have learned up to this point.

# What I learned?

So Im still not a 100 percent sure how to make sections a certain height but i gave them some margins and padding to give them room between sections.
The spacing might be a little off but its okay not to be pixil perfect.
I might have used to many divs to make things do certain things like be 1000px wide without making the background that wide.
